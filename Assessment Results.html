                Online personality tests can be a good way to gain some perspective on one's self. <b>However</b>, the results must be taken 
                with a grain of salt as:</p>
                
                <!--Displays Data in an ordered list with numerical type bullets-->    
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Little to no research might have been done to validate the findings.</li>
                <br>
                <li>They are less rigorous because they are not administered by professionals</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>In relation to my results, considering that I answered the quaestions truthfully, the test seems to have some validity 
                because the results aligned closely to my personality traits</p>
