                    Patience- Within the past few years, I have tried to be more patient with others. 
                    I've learned to accept that if something or something isn't operating at the pace that I want it to, it doesn't 
                    make sense to complain it. Instead, I maintain a level head until a situation works out.
                 </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Determination- When I was younger, I used to give up easily on everything even if I really wanted. Thankfully, I've 
                    learned to curb that behaviour and push to through procrastination.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Outgoing- Being the introvert that I am, I used to lack enthusiasm about anything that didn't involve me avoiding 
                    crowds and being by myself. I've since been stepping out of my comfort zone by forcing myself to participate in events 
                    that would normally avoid as a means of becoming more outgoing. So far it has worked.
