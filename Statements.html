                My goal is to have to a career in software engineering or to get a job that I will enjoy equally. Each day, I will spend at 
                least one hour trying to learn a new concept or aspect of development so I can make daily improvements. Then, I can build  new 
                prorams from scratch that I can use as my portfolio to show my skills off to my community. Along the way, Iâ€™ll collect 
                testimonials from the people I help with their computer related problems so I can build a community of interesting, happy and 
                supportive people.
